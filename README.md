# Hello, wanderer

Hi, I’m Riccardo, or Richard — currently studying at [École 42](https://42lausanne.ch/).  


It’s a project-based school where you learn by doing, working with others, and figuring things out by yourself.  

Here are some of the things we learn there:

![Data Structures](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Data%20Structures-555555?logo=geeksforgeeks&logoColor=white)

![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Git-F05032?logo=git&logoColor=white)
![Teamwork](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Peer%20Learning-0A66C2?logo=42&logoColor=white)
![Problem Solving](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Problem%20Solving-6C63FF?logo=leetcode&logoColor=white)


I’m focused on building a solid understanding of how things work under the hood.

So far, this school has been extremely challenging, but I would recommend it to everyone.

**Bref:** it’s extremely exigent, but forgiving at the same time. I love it.

## 💻 Web Development


Before joining 42, I spent some time learning **web development** and building small projects using the **MERN stack** at [The Bridge](https://thebridge.tech/):

![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MongoDB-47A248?logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)
![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Express.js-000000?logo=express&logoColor=white)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=black)
![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933?logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=black)
![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MySQL-4479A1?logo=mysql&logoColor=white)
![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-E34F26?logo=html5&logoColor=white)
![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-1572B6?logo=css3&logoColor=white)
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Git-F05032?logo=git&logoColor=white)

I still like building things for the web when I have time.

## 🌿 Outside of Code


Outside of coding, I like cooking (I’ve been doing it professionally for about 15 years), specially for my friends.

I also enjoy a lot indie games, and music. I can be a real geek about this haha :)
